### Branch Conventions

- `master` is release branch and should remain stable at all times.
- Create feature branches for your in-progress features and using the format `<username>/my-feature` (doesn't have to be your GitHub username, just use something identifiable and be consistent about it).
- We use a variation of Conventional Commits specification for commit messages:
- Use `[service] feat: my commit message` instead of `feat: my commit message`.

### Commit Conventions

Prefix your commits with these identifiers for better organization of Git history - `<identifier-service> <commit message>`. For example: `[user-service] feat: build oauth protocol`.

- `[frontend]` - frontend changes
- `[user-service]` - backend changes
- `[misc]` - miscellaneous changes
